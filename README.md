# Random Number - Codespace Project

Random Number Guessing Game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10 within 3 attempts. The game provides hints to help the player figure out if their guess is too high or too low, and it informs them whether they won or lost after the attempts are finished.

### Features:
- Interactive UI: The page displays dynamically:

  - The number of attempts remaining.
  - A hint telling the player whether their guess is too high or too low.
  - A message indicating whether the player has won or lost.
  - Computer Choice: The game uses a function to generate a random number between 1 and 10.

- Input Validation: The game ensures valid input through:

  - HTML attributes (e.g., input type number, min 1 and max 10).
  - JavaScript checks to ensure the input is a number within the valid range.
